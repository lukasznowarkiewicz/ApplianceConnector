## Initial idea - visible gap on the market

The history behing this device came from my experience - I used to install smart home systems and saw some market gap in integrating smart home devices which oryginally was not intended to be "smart". I have in mind devices controlled over infrared, like air condationers, TVs, home theaters, audio systems, satellite and cable boxes, projectors, controlled over serial port (RS-232), like projectors, some audio entertainment systems, video conferencing systems, surveillance camera systems, etc., finishing on most simple, controlled with dry contact, like garage and gate openers, access control systems or blinds and curtains systesm, to just name a few. Backbone of most smart home systems in the end, almost always is TCP/IP network. Proabably the most universal method between both vendor locked and open smart home systems is communication via REST API. This device main prupose was to cover this gap, allow integration of all listed devices in thoughtfully manner.
